# Enhanced Speed Queue (for RemNote)

A plugin by **jerdaw** to supercharge your RemNote flashcard review speed and focus. This plugin builds upon the original "Queue Speed Mode" by Jamesb.

## Planned Features (Work in Progress)

This plugin aims to provide a highly configurable speed-review experience:

-   **Customizable Timer Bar:** A slim, 1px tall progress bar with user-configurable colors.
-   **Flexible Auto-Answer:** Choose to automatically mark cards as "Again" or "Skip" them.
-   **Additive Timers:** Configure alarm, auto-show answer, and auto-answer times as sequential, additive delays for intuitive setup.
-   **Continuous Alarm Option:** An optional repeating alarm that dings at user-defined intervals until the answer is revealed.
-   **Improved Settings UI:** Clearer organization and descriptions for all options.

### Original Features (from Queue Speed Mode)

-   Stay focused by answering cards within a time limit.
-   If the time runs out an alert will play.
-   Auto show the answer and rate the card after a certain amount of time.

-   Enable/disable auto-answer.
